Ever wanted to have a Real-Life Valorant Spike? *probably not*

Here's the layout of components.

We don't have a prototype yet, expect that to come soon!

## Why though?
 We think the Valorant spike looks pretty cool and would be pretty fun to use it in a airsoft battle for example. + we were bored so yeah.

## Our plans?
Creating it in real life, 3D printing the spike and adding more electronics + a battery.
